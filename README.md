# rlox: A Rust Implementation of ‚ÄúCrafting Interpreters‚Äù

A work-in-progress Rust implementation of Robert Nystrom's Lox language, as presented in [*Crafting Interpreters*](https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html).

For each completed stage, I document my progress in a post, which is listed in the [Related post(s)](#related-posts) section below.

## To Run

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/behai-nguyen/rlox.git
```

Change to the ``rlox`` directory. The application can be run interactively or with a Lox script file.

üí• The application's behavior will evolve as development progresses. As a result, the discussions below will be updated accordingly.

### To Run Interactively

```
$ cargo run
```

Enter something like ``var str2 = "Áßã„ÅÆÁµÇ„Çè„Çä";``, and press ``Enter`` ‚Äî you will see the tokens printed out.

Currently, inputs are treated independently, meaning each new input has no relation to the previous one.

To exit, simply press ``Enter`` without entering anything.

### To Run with a Lox Script File

```
$ cargo run ./tests/data/scanning/numbers.lox
```

If there are no errors, you will see the tokens printed out.
