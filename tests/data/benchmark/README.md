**Please note:**

Scripts are from 
[ https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters/tree/master/test/benchmark/ ](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters/tree/master/test/benchmark).

Only `equality.lox`, `fib.lox`, and `string_equality.lox` can be run for this code version. They are not in automatic tests. Run them via the CLI application, for example:

```
cargo run ./tests/data/benchmark/equality.lox
```

They do take awhile to finish: [reference](https://behainguyen.wordpress.com/2025/08/01/rlox-a-rust-implementation-of-crafting-interpreters-functions/#author-benchmarking-scripts).
